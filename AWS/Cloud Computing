Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software,
and applications are provided as a service to users on-demand. Instead of having to manage and maintain physical hardware and software, 
users can access these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. 
This enables organizations to focus on their core business activities rather than managing IT infrastructure. 
Cloud computing has become a popular solution for many industries, including business, education, and healthcare.
