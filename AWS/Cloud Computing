Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software,
and applications are provided as a service to users on-demand. Instead of having to manage and maintain physical hardware and software, 
users can access these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. 
This enables organizations to focus on their core business activities rather than managing IT infrastructure. 
Cloud computing has become a popular solution for many industries, including business, education, and healthcare.

There are 4  types of Cloud computing services
1.infrastructure as a service (IaaS), 
2.platform as a service (PaaS), 
3.software as a service (SaaS), 
4.serverless computing.

Advantages:
1.Cloud computing offers numerous advantages, including scalability, flexibility, and reduced costs.
2.With cloud computing, users can access computing resources on-demand, eliminating the need for upfront capital expenditures on hardware and software. 
3.Additionally, cloud computing enables on-the-go access to data and applications, making it an ideal solution for remote teams and mobile workers. 
4.Another significant advantage is the automatic software updates, which ensure that systems are always running with the latest security patches and features. 
5.Furthermore, cloud computing allows for increased collaboration, with team members able to access and share files seamlessly from anywhere.

Disadvantages:

1.One major disadvantage is the reliance on a third-party provider, which can lead to data security and management concerns. 
2.Additionally, cloud computing often requires a high-speed internet connection, which can be a challenge in areas with limited connectivity. 
3.Furthermore, the risk of data loss or corruption due to external factors is higher in cloud computing. 
4.Lastly, cloud computing can be expensive, especially for small or medium-sized businesses.
