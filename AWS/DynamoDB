NoSQL:

The term "NoSQL" refers to a type of database that doesn't use the traditional table-based relational model used in relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, 
and Microsoft SQL Server. Instead, NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide a more flexible and scalable data storage option. 
They often use keys for data retrieval, rather than SQL queries, and are used in big data and real-time web applications.
Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
