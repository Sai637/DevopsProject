Elastic Block Store (EBS):
#############################
*Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. 
*EBS volumes are stored on the AWS storage infrastructure, and are designed to provide high levels of availability, durability, and performance.
*EBS is suitable for applications that require high throughput, low latency, and high storage capacity. 
*Some common use cases for EBS include database storage, file servers, and virtualized servers. 
*EBS provides snapshotting and volume migration features, making it easier to manage and maintain data.
*These volumes can be used to store data, including the operating system of the instance, 
and persist independently from the life of the instance.

1.Persistent Storage:

EBS volumes persist independently of the life of the EC2 instance, ensuring that your data is retained even if the instance is stopped or terminated.

2.Scalable and Flexible:

Volumes can be resized, and you can increase their capacity, performance, or change their type with no downtime.

3.Encryption:

EBS volumes support encryption to protect your data at rest. Encryption is provided by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

4.High Availability and Durability:

EBS volumes are designed for 99.999% availability and automatically replicate within an Availability Zone to protect against hardware failure.

5.Snapshots:

Create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, which are stored in Amazon S3. Snapshots can be used to create new EBS volumes or to back up data.

Types of Volumes:

1.General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2): Balanced price and performance for a wide variety of workloads.
2.Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1): High-performance SSDs designed for critical applications requiring sustained IOPS performance.
3.Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): Low-cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.
4.Cold HDD (sc1): Lowest-cost HDD designed for less frequently accessed workloads.




1. Creating an EBS Volume:
Open the Amazon EC2 Console:

Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Create Volume:

In the left-hand navigation pane, click on Volumes under Elastic Block Store.
Click the Create Volume button.
Configure Volume:

Select the volume type (e.g., gp2 for General Purpose SSD).
Specify the size of the volume.
Choose the Availability Zone where the volume will be created (must match the Availability Zone of the EC2 instance you want to attach it to).
Configure additional settings such as encryption if needed.
Click Create Volume.
2. Attaching an EBS Volume to an EC2 Instance:
Select Volume:

In the Volumes section of the EC2 Dashboard, select the volume you created.
Attach Volume:

Click the Actions dropdown and select Attach Volume.
Choose the instance to attach the volume to.
Specify the device name (e.g., /dev/xvdf).
Click Attach Volume.
3. Making the Volume Available on the EC2 Instance:
Connect to the Instance:

SSH into the EC2 instance where the volume was attached.
Format the Volume (if new):

Create a filesystem on the volume (if itâ€™s a new volume). For example, to format as ext4:
sh:

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
Mount the Volume:

Create a mount point and mount the volume:
sh:

sudo mkdir /mnt/myebs
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myebs
Update /etc/fstab (Optional):

To mount the volume automatically at boot, you can add an entry to the /etc/fstab file:
sh:

/dev/xvdf /mnt/myebs ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
4. Creating and Using EBS Snapshots:
Create a Snapshot:

In the Volumes section, select the volume.
Click Actions and select Create Snapshot.
Provide a description and click Create Snapshot.
Restore from a Snapshot:

In the Snapshots section, select the snapshot.
Click Actions and select Create Volume from Snapshot.
Configure the volume settings and click Create Volume.
Best Practices for Using EBS:
Regular Snapshots:

Regularly create snapshots of your EBS volumes to ensure you have backups of your data.
Monitor Performance:

Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor EBS metrics and adjust volume types or sizes based on performance needs.
Use EBS-Optimized Instances:

Consider using EBS-optimized EC2 instances to ensure dedicated throughput between EC2 and EBS.
Encryption:

Encrypt sensitive data stored on EBS volumes.
Instance Store for Temporary Data:

Use instance store volumes for temporary data that does not require persistence, 
as they are faster and cheaper but do not survive instance stops and starts.
