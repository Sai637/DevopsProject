AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 
It enables you to manage users and groups, and their corresponding access to specific AWS resources and services.
With IAM, you can create and manage IAM users, roles, and groups, as well as set permissions for each entity. 
This helps to ensure that each entity has the necessary permissions to access the resources they need to perform their job, 
while preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the security of your AWS resources.

Identity and access management is for making sure that only the right people can access an organization's data and resources. 
It's a cybersecurity practice that enables IT administrators to restrict access to organizational resources so that only the people who need access have access.

IAM provides a real-life example of how IAM is used in AWS to manage user access and permissions. 
It explains how IAM allows you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform, 
ensuring the security of your AWS environment.
IAM in AWS is a powerful tool for managing access to your AWS resources securely and efficiently.
