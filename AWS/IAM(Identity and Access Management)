IAM(Identity and Access Management)
#######################
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 
It enables you to manage users and groups, and their corresponding access to specific AWS resources and services.
With IAM, you can create and manage IAM users, roles, and groups, as well as set permissions for each entity. 
This helps to ensure that each entity has the necessary permissions to access the resources they need to perform their job, 
while preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the security of your AWS resources.

Identity and access management is for making sure that only the right people can access an organization's data and resources. 
It's a cybersecurity practice that enables IT administrators to restrict access to organizational resources so that only the people who need access have access.

IAM provides a real-life example of how IAM is used in AWS to manage user access and permissions. 
It explains how IAM allows you to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform, 
ensuring the security of your AWS environment.
IAM in AWS is a powerful tool for managing access to your AWS resources securely and efficiently.

IAM Policy:

An IAM policy in AWS defines the permissions that a user, group, or role has to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.
A policy is a document that specifies the permissions, and it's used to grant, deny, or revoke access to resources. 
IAM policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and consist of a series of statements that define the permissions.
Each statement specifies the actions, resources, and conditions that determine whether the permission is granted

Core Components of IAM
1. Users
Represent a person or application interacting with AWS.
Each user can:
Have a unique set of credentials.
Be assigned permissions directly or through groups.
Best Practice: Avoid using root credentials; create users with specific permissions.

2. Groups
A collection of users with common permissions.
Example: A Developers group might have access to development resources but not production.

3. Roles
A role is a set of permissions assigned to entities.
Use Cases:
Allow an EC2 instance to interact with an S3 bucket.
Enable cross-account access.
Grant temporary permissions for federated users.

4. Policies
JSON documents that define permissions.
Structure:
Effect: Allow or Deny.
Action: AWS service actions (e.g., s3:ListBucket).
Resource: Resources affected (e.g., arn:aws:s3:::mybucket).
Condition: Optional; specifies conditions for the policy.
Example Policy:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}

5. Access Keys
Used by applications to interact with AWS APIs.
Access consists of:
Access Key ID: Identifies the key.
Secret Access Key: Used for signing API requests.

Service Access:

Assign an IAM role to an EC2 instance to allow it to access an S3 bucket securely.
Cross-Account Access:

Enable users in one AWS account to access resources in another account.
