A query about AWS and lambda! Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), allowing developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
It's a highly scalable and flexible solution for handling spikes in application traffic or variable workload. 
You can write code in various languages, including Node.js, Python, and Java, and AWS Lambda will automatically manage the infrastructure, 
scaling your code up or down as needed. With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed by your code, making it a cost-effective solution for many applications.
