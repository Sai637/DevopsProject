A load balancer in AWS is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or lambda functions.
This helps to improve the reliability, scalability, and performance of your application by ensuring that no single instance or resource is overwhelmed with traffic. 
AWS offers three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer (CLB). 
Each type is designed for specific use cases and can be used to route traffic to different types of targets.

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients.
The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. 
This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.

A load balancer in AWS is a service that helps distribute traffic across multiple servers to improve the responsiveness and availability of a website or application.
It ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed, reducing the risk of downtime and errors. 
AWS offers two types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer. 
Application Load Balancer is designed for Layer 7 traffic and is suitable for web applications, 
while Network Load Balancer is designed for Layer 4 traffic and is suitable for large-scale applications. 
Both load balancers can be deployed in various regions and Availability Zones.

Load balancers improve application performance by increasing response time and reducing network latency.

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, 
containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.
