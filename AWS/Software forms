The Full Form of HTTPS is HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. 
HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is a secure HTTP encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) convention. 
HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, enables protected communication over the computer network.
###################################
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is a transport-layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP).
It provides reliable, connection-oriented communication over IP networks, ensuring data delivery in the correct order and error-free
#########################################
VPC---virtual Private cloud
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
It allows you to configure a boundary around your resources in the cloud, providing a secure environment for your applications.
A VPC is defined by a range of IP addresses and is isolated from other VPCs or the internet. 
You can configure settings such as subnets, security groups, and network ACLs to control access and traffic flow within your VPC. 
This provides a secure and scalable environment for running your applications in the cloud.
#########################################
TLS(Transport layer security)

The query term "allow_tls" likely refers to a configuration option in computing and networking. 
In particular, it may pertain to the capability of allowing or enabling the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol,
which is a cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communication over a computer network.
TLS is widely used to secure website communications, ensuring a safe and encrypted connection between a user's browser and a website. 
In this context, "allow_tls" might be a setting or parameter that enables the use of TLS, enhancing the security of network data transfers.
#####################################################

EKS stands for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. 
It's a managed service that makes it easier to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates the management, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications

##########################################################
CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It's a method of assigning IP addresses to devices that connect to the internet,
and it's used to improve the efficiency of data routing
####################################################

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. 
It is used for establishing and managing connections between devices on a network, ensuring reliable and orderly delivery of data.

##########################################################

The query term "TLS" stands for Transport Layer Security.
It is a cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communication over a computer network, particularly to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.
TLS is an improved version of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is widely used to secure web communications, 
including web browsing, email, and instant messaging. It ensures that data exchanged between a client and a server remains confidential and authentic.

#########################################################

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. 
It is a cryptographic protocol that was originally designed to provide secure communication over the internet. 
SSL establishes an encrypted link between a web server and a browser, ensuring that all data passed between them remains private and protected.

####################################################
While SSL is now considered outdated and has been replaced by TLS (Transport Layer Security), the term SSL is still commonly used to refer to TLS protocols as well.
