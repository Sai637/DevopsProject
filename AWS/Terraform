Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used for building and managing cloud and on-premises infrastructure.
Developed by HashiCorp, Terraform allows users to define and version infrastructure configurations in human-readable configuration files,
which can then be used to create and manage virtual machines, networks, and other resources on various cloud and on-premises platforms. 
Terraform supports a wide range of providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others,
making it a popular choice for organizations seeking to standardize and automate their infrastructure management processes.

terraform variables

Terraform variables are values that can be used to customize the behavior of Terraform configurations throughout a workspace.
These values are stored in a variables.tf file and can be used to parameterize infrastructure as code. 
There are two types of variables in Terraform: local and input. 
Local variables are only accessible within the scope of the module or configuration they are declared in, while input variables are available throughout the entire workspace. 
Terraform variables can be set through command-line options, environment variables, or a variables.tf file.

StateFile:

A Terraform state file is a JSON file that stores information about resources in your infrastructure, such as their IDs, 
attributes, and dependencies. It's created after running terraform apply and is usually named terraform.
tfstate and located in the same directory as Terraform. 

Terraform uses the state file to: 
Track resource state: Accurately account for the current state of your infrastructure 
Manage resource dependencies: Understand how resources depend on each other 
Plan and apply operations: Compare the desired state (your configuration) to the current state (the state file) 
Improve performance: Optimize performance for large infrastructures 
The state file contains information such as: 
Resource information: Resource IDs, attributes (like IP addresses and security group rules), and dependencies 
Metadata: Resource names, tags, and other configuration details 
Version: The Terraform version 
Serial: The serial 
Lineage: The lineage 
Outputs: The outputs 
Some recommend storing state in HCP Terraform to version, encrypt, and securely share it with your team. 
Terraform also uses a lock on the state file to prevent concurrent modifications that could lead to conflicts or data corruption.

Restoring statefile:

If the statefile is deleted or corrupted ,we can restore it using Terraform import command.

The terraform import command is used to import an existing infrastructure resource from a cloud or on-premises environment into a Terraform configuration. 
This command allows you to manage existing resources alongside newly created ones within your Terraform state.
The command syntax is terraform import <resource> <id>, where <resource> is the resource type and <id> is a unique identifier
of the resource. For example, terraform import aws_instance.web i-abc123 would import an AWS EC2 instance with the ID i-abc123 into your Terraform configuration.

     terraform import azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association.association1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myvnet1/subnets/mysubnet1

Terraform remote backend or remote statefile:

Terraform's remote backend and remote state are both ways to store Terraform state in a remote location, like a database or cloud object storage service.

When working with Terraform, a remote backend allows you to store and manage your infrastructure state remotely,
rather than on your local machine. This provides several benefits, including improved collaboration, version control, and disaster recovery.
A remote state file is a file stored in the remote backend, which contains the current state of your infrastructure. 
Popular remote backend options include AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. 
By using a remote backend, you can ensure that your infrastructure state is always synchronized and accessible from anywhere.

How do I store Terraform state file remotely?

Here are the steps on how to store Terraform state file on Terraform cloud Remote:
Create a Terraform Cloud organization and workspace.
Create a configuration file that defines the resources you want to create.
Initialize Terraform.
Configure Terraform Cloud to store the state file.
Authentication with Terraform Cloud.
