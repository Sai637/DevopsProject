A VPC, short for Virtual Private Cloud, is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
It is a virtual version of a traditional network, logically isolated from other virtual networks in the same AWS account. 
A VPC allows you to launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets, in a virtual environment 
that is separate from other AWS accounts or other VPCs. You can configure your VPC's IP address range, subnets, and routing to meet your specific network requirements. 
VPCs are highly secure, scalable, and offer a high degree of customization.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is an essential AWS feature that enables customers to establish virtual networks within the cloud. 
VPC protects and isolates EC2 instances, databases and load balancers while protecting from attack by outside forces such as hackers.
