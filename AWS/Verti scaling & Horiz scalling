Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, is an AWS practice that increases the power of a virtual machine (EC2 instance) by adjusting its computing resources, such as the number of CPU cores, memory, and storage capacity. 
This approach is suitable for applications that require consistent high performance and suitable for workloads that don't fluctuate greatly. 
AWS provides several instance types, each with varying levels of resources, allowing users to scale up or down as needed. 
Additionally, AWS auto-scaling enables automatic scaling based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.


Horizontal scaling is a common technique used to increase the capacity of a system or application.
In Amazon Web Services (AWS), horizontal scaling can be achieved through several methods. One way is by using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), 
which distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Another method is by using Auto Scaling, which automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand. 
Additionally, AWS provides services like Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Kubernetes, which support containerized applications and horizontal scaling.
By scaling horizontally, you can handle increased traffic and improve the overall performance of your application.
