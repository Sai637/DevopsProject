 Jenkins uses a master-slave architecture, where the master node is the central point responsible for task scheduling, monitoring,
and managing build processes. The slave nodes, also known as agents, run the actual builds and perform the tasks assigned by the master node. 
This architecture enables scalability, reliability, and ease of use for large-scale software development and deployment operations.
