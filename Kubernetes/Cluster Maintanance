We need to take node01 out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
This command:
Evicts all pods from the node (except DaemonSet pods).
Ensures that no new pods are scheduled on the node

kubectl cordon node01 --->no new pods assigned to node01 until it set to uncordon state

kubectl uncordon node01  --->The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node node01 to be schedulable again

Why are the pods placed on the controlplane node? ----> Controlplane does not have taints

Upgrading a cluster involves 2 major steps
There are different strategies that are available to upgrade the worker nodes
One is to upgrade all at once. But then your pods will be down and users will not be able to access the applications.

Second one is to upgrade one node at a time.

Third one would be to add new nodes to the cluster
