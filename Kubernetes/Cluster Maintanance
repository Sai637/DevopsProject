We need to take node01 out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
This command:
Evicts all pods from the node (except DaemonSet pods).
Ensures that no new pods are scheduled on the node

kubectl cordon node01 --->no new pods assigned to node01 until it set to uncordon state

kubectl uncordon node01  --->The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node node01 to be schedulable again

Why are the pods placed on the controlplane node? ----> Controlplane does not have taints
