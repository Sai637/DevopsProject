ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. 
It exposes the service on an internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster, making it accessible only from within the cluster.
This is useful for internal services that do not need to be exposed to external traffic.

How ClusterIP Works
When you create a ClusterIP service, Kubernetes allocates an IP address for the service within the cluster. 
This IP is only reachable from within the cluster, and the service routes traffic to the pods that match the service's selector.
