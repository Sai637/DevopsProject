Docker:

Docker is a popular open-source containerization platform that enables the development, deployment, and management of applications in containers.
Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package an application with its dependencies, allowing developers to deploy applications consistently across different environments. 
Docker provides a runtime environment for containers, making it easy to create, run, and manage multiple isolated containers on a single host OS.
This approach provides improved resource utilization, faster deployment, and enhanced scalability. 
Docker has become a widely-used tool in modern software development, DevOps, and cloud computing.


what is docker file:

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions, or commands, for building a Docker image.
This file serves as a blueprint for creating a containerized application. 
The Dockerfile specifies the base image, sets environment variables, copies files and directories, and configures the application, among other tasks. 
Once a Dockerfile is created, you can build an image by running the command "docker build" followed by the path to the Dockerfile.
The resulting image can then be run as a container using the "docker run" command. 
This allows for easy deployment and management of applications in containers.
