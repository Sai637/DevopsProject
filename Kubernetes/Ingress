ingress in kubernetes

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is a centralized point of entry for incoming HTTP requests. 
It allows multiple services to be accessed through a single IP and port. 
The Ingress resource is responsible for routing incoming traffic to the relevant service, allowing for load balancing, SSL termination, 
and hostname-based routing. An Ingress controller forwards incoming requests to the corresponding service within the cluster.
This facilitates a scalable and maintainable way to manage incoming traffic in Kubernetes applications.

Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that helps developers expose their applications and 
manage external access by providing http/s routing rules to the services within a Kubernetes cluster.

In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS routes. 
It provides a way to expose multiple services over the same IP address and route traffic based on hostnames or paths. 
Essentially, Ingress acts as a more flexible and powerful alternative to other options like NodePort or LoadBalancer services.
