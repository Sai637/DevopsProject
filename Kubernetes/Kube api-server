Kube-apiserver is responsible for authenticating, validating requests, retrieving and Updating data in ETCD key-value store. 
In fact kube-apiserver is the only component that interacts directly to the etcd datastore.
The other components such as kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and kubelet uses the API-Server to update in the cluster in their respective areas.

The Kube API Server is a primary component of the Kubernetes control plane, responsible for managing and exposing the Application Programming Interface (API) for cluster resources.
It exposed the Kubernetes API to users and accepts CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations from clients. 
The API Server authenticates and authorizes users, validates and processes requests, and updates the etcd database.
It's the entry point for most users and systems interacting with the cluster, allowing them to manage and manipulate cluster resources such as pods, services, and deployments
