A LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes is used to expose a service to external traffic by provisioning a load balancer provided by the underlying cloud infrastructure (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.).
This type of service automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple pods and ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your application.

How LoadBalancer Works
When you create a LoadBalancer service, Kubernetes requests a cloud provider to provision an external load balancer. 
The load balancer receives incoming traffic and forwards it to the backend pods associated with the service.

External Load Balancer:

Typically provisioned by a cloud provider.
Distributes traffic from external clients (e.g., the internet) to services running within the Kubernetes cluster.
Example: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer.

Internal Load Balancer:

Distributes traffic within a private network or between services inside a cluster.
Often used for communication between microservices.

It automatically provisions an external load balancer when you create a Service of type LoadBalancer.
