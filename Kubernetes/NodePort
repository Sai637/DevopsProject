what is nodeport in kubernetes:

In Kubernetes, a NodePort is a type of service that exposes a container's port on each machine (node) in a cluster. 
It allows external traffic to access the service directly by using a static port number on each node. 
NodePorts are typically used for development environments, testing, and demos. When a NodePort is created,
Kubernetes allocates a unique port number on each node's exposed ports (30000-32767) and maps it to the container's port.
This allows clients to access the service using the node's IP and the allocated port number.

A NodePort is a type of service in Kubernetes that exposes your application on a specific port on each node in your cluster. 
This allows external traffic to access your application by using the IP address of any node in the cluster along with the specified port.
