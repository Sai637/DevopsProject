Prometheus and Grafana are two popular open-source tools used in monitoring and observability.
Prometheus is a monitoring system and time series database that collects metrics from applications and services. 
It provides a query language (PromQL) for retrieving and aggregating data. 
Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization platform that uses Prometheus data to create dashboards, graphs, and charts. 
While Prometheus focuses on collecting and storing data, Grafana focuses on visualizing and analyzing that data.

Itâ€™s a powerful tool for creating real-time monitoring dashboards.
Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source and provides a flexible interface to visualize those metrics through dashboards.
Together, they form a powerful combination for monitoring and observability, especially in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes.
In short, Prometheus is the data collector, and Grafana is the data viewer.
