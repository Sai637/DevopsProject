Prometheus and Grafana are two popular open-source tools used in monitoring and observability.
Prometheus is a monitoring system and time series database that collects metrics from applications and services. 
It provides a query language (PromQL) for retrieving and aggregating data. 
Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization platform that uses Prometheus data to create dashboards, graphs, and charts. 
While Prometheus focuses on collecting and storing data, Grafana focuses on visualizing and analyzing that data.
In short, Prometheus is the data collector, and Grafana is the data viewer.
