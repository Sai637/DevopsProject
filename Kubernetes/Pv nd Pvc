pv in kubernetes

PV stands for Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes. 
It is a resource that provides persistent storage to pods.
PVs are managed by the cluster and are decoupled from pods, ensuring that when a pod is deleted or recreated, the data stored in the PV is preserved.
PVs can be provisioned statically by cluster administrators or dynamically through storage classes.
They can be attached to pods using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and can be used for storing applications' data, logs, or other persistent data.

pvc in kubernetes

PVC (Persistent Volumes Claim) is a Kubernetes feature that allows you to request storage resources from a cluster.
A PVC is a request for storage that is provisioned and managed by a cluster administrator. 
Once a PVC is created, it can be bound to a Persistent Volume (PV), which is a resource in the cluster 
that represents a piece of networked storage. PVCs provide a way to decouple storage from the deployment of an application, 
allowing for more flexibility and scalability in the deployment of stateful applications.


storage class in kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a storage class is a way to request storage with specific characteristics, such as type and size, without explicitly specifying the underlying Persistent Volumes (PVs).
When a Pod requests storage, Kubernetes creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and binds it to a matching PV.
This decouples the application from the storage infrastructure, allowing for easier scaling and flexibility. 
Storage classes can be used to provision storage from various sources, such as local disks, NFS, or object storage like Amazon S3. 
They provide a standardized way to interact with storage resources in Kubernetes.
