In Kubernetes, a Service Account is a type of account specifically used by applications or workloads running within the cluster, 
rather than by human users. Service accounts allow pods  and other Kubernetes resources to securely interact with the Kubernetes API, and 
perform actions such as creating persistent volumes, deploying applications, and interacting with other resources.
They help enforce security by restricting what the application can access within the cluster.
Each namespace has a default service account that is automatically attached to pods if no other service account is specified.

Using Service Acount in a Pod:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: custom-service-account
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-application-image
