There are 5 types of services:
ClusterIP
NodePort
LoadBalancer
External Name
Headless

ClusterIP:

ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. 
It exposes the service on an internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster, making it accessible only from within the cluster.
This is useful for internal services that do not need to be exposed to external traffic.

How ClusterIP Works
When you create a ClusterIP service, Kubernetes allocates an IP address for the service within the cluster. 
This IP is only reachable from within the cluster, and the service routes traffic to the pods that match the service's selector.

Pod yaml file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.21
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Label selector to find the pods this service will expose
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80        # Port to access the service
      targetPort: 8080  # Port on the pod that the service will forward traffic to
  type: ClusterIP  # The type of service (defaults to ClusterIP)

NodePort:

In Kubernetes, a NodePort is a type of service that exposes a container's port on each machine (node) in a cluster. 
It allows external traffic to access the service directly by using a static port number on each node. 
NodePorts are typically used for development environments, testing, and demos. When a NodePort is created,
Kubernetes allocates a unique port number on each node's exposed ports (30000-32767) and maps it to the container's port.
This allows clients to access the service using the node's IP and the allocated port number.

A NodePort is a type of service in Kubernetes that exposes your application on a specific port on each node in your cluster. 
This allows external traffic to access your application by using the IP address of any node in the cluster along with the specified port.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007

What is a kube-proxy?
Kube-Proxy and CNI: The Hidden Components of Kubernetes ...
Kube-Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster.
It is responsible for maintaining network connectivity between services and pods.
Kube-Proxy does this by translating service definitions into actionable networking rules
