TLS (Transport Layer Security) in Kubernetes enables secure communication between pods and services. 
Kubernetes uses TLS certificates and keys to establish secure connections. 
You can configure TLS in Kubernetes using ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Certificates. 
ConfigMaps and Secrets store sensitive data, such as certificates and keys, which can be used to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) or a self-signed certificate.
Certificates can be generated using tools like OpenSSL or CertManager. 
This setup ensures secure communication within your Kubernetes cluster and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
