By default, Kubernetes tries to schedule a pod on any available node unless the node has a taint that prevents this.
Taint:

A taint is a label applied to a node that affects the pod scheduling decision
In Kubernetes, Taints and Tolerations work together to control the scheduling of pods to nodes. 
They help ensure that specific pods are either allowed or prevented from running on certain nodes,
based on custom conditions or node-specific requirements.


"kubectl taint nodes node01 key=value:NoSchedule"

This means no pod will be scheduled on node1 unless it has a toleration for this taint

Effect options:

NoSchedule: New pods that do not tolerate this taint cannot be scheduled on this node.
PreferNoSchedule: The system tries to avoid scheduling new pods that do not tolerate this taint, but it’s not guaranteed.
NoExecute: New pods and existing pods that do not tolerate this taint will be evicted or won’t be scheduled.


Tolerations:
A toleration is applied to pods to allow them to tolerate specific taints on nodes, 
meaning they can be scheduled on nodes that have matching taints.

Tolerations allow pods to "tolerate" the taints applied to nodes.

tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"



Taints are applied to nodes to control pod scheduling, either preventing pods from being scheduled or evicting them.
Tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to bypass taints and run on nodes with specific taints.
