Prometheus is an open-source technology designed to provide monitoring and alerting functionality for cloud-native environments, including Kubernetes. . 
It collects metrics from various sources, stores them in a time-series database, and allows for querying and visualization of the data. 
Prometheus supports multiple data sources, including Prometheus servers, Node Exporter, and other third-party exporters. 
It also offers a powerful query language called PromQL, which enables users to write complex queries to extract insights from the data.

Prometheus is often used in conjunction with other tools like Grafana, which provides a graphical interface for visualizing the metrics collected by Prometheus.
Key Feature:

1.Metric Collection:
Prometheus collects metrics from applications and systems via HTTP endpoints that expose metrics in a specific format.
Metrics are usually in the form of a time series (values recorded against timestamps).

2.Pull-Based Model:
Prometheus uses a pull-based model where it periodically scrapes metrics from target endpoints.

3.Multi-Dimensional Data Model:
Metrics are identified using a unique metric name and labels (key-value pairs) for dimensional data.
Example: http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}.

4.Powerful Query Language (PromQL):
Prometheus includes PromQL, a rich query language for slicing, dicing, and aggregating time-series data.

5.Time-Series Database (TSDB):
Prometheus comes with an embedded TSDB that stores metrics efficiently.

6.Service Discovery:
Prometheus supports dynamic target discovery using integrations with Kubernetes, Consul, EC2, and more.

7.Alerting:
Includes Alertmanager for sending notifications based on metric thresholds or anomalies.
Supports integrations with Slack, PagerDuty, email, and more.

Standalone and Distributed Monitoring:
Prometheus is designed to work as a standalone system. For scaling, it can be paired with tools like Thanos or Cortex.

Architecture of Prometheus
The Prometheus ecosystem typically consists of the following components:
1.Prometheus Server:
Core component that scrapes metrics, stores them in the TSDB, and executes queries.

2.Exporters:
Applications that expose metrics in Prometheus' format.
Examples: node_exporter for system metrics, blackbox_exporter for endpoint monitoring.

3.Alertmanager:
Handles alerts generated by Prometheus based on alerting rules.
Manages deduplication, grouping, and sending notifications.

4.Pushgateway:
Allows ephemeral or batch jobs to expose metrics by pushing them to Prometheus.

Prometheus Workflow (Brief Overview)
Prometheus follows a systematic process to collect, store, query, and alert on metrics data. Here's a concise explanation:

1.Target Discovery:
Prometheus identifies monitoring targets via static configurations or dynamic service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, or Consul).

2.Metric Scraping:
Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from targets by sending HTTP requests to their /metrics endpoints. Applications expose these metrics using client libraries or exporters.

3.Data Storage:
Collected metrics are stored in Prometheus' time-series database (TSDB), organized by metric names and labels (key-value pairs).

4.Querying (PromQL):
Prometheus uses PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to retrieve and analyze stored metrics. Queries are used for debugging, reporting, and feeding data into dashboards.

5.Alerting:
Prometheus evaluates defined alerting rules. When conditions are met, it triggers alerts and sends them to Alertmanager, which handles notifications (e.g., Slack, email).

6.Visualization:
Metrics data is visualized using tools like Grafana or Prometheusâ€™ built-in UI to create dashboards for monitoring system health and performance.
