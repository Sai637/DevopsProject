1.Variables and Data Types:
Variables store data, and Python supports various data types like integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries.

name = "sai"
age = 24
marks=[1,2,3,4]
dic={a:1,b:2}

2.Control Statements:
Python supports if, else, elif for conditional logic, and loops like for and while for iterating over data.

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

3.Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called with different arguments.

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

greet("sai")
