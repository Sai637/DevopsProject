1.Variables and Data Types:
Variables store data, and Python supports various data types like integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries.

name = "sai"
age = 24
marks=[1,2,3,4]
dic={a:1,b:2}

2.Control Statements:
Python supports if, else, elif for conditional logic, and loops like for and while for iterating over data.

number = -10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative")
else:
    print("The number is zero")

3.Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called with different arguments.

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
result = factorial(5)
print(f"The factorial of 5 is {result}")


4.Loops
Loops (for, while) are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(f"Number: {number}")

Using a while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1

5.Lists and List Comprehensions
Lists are ordered collections, and list comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.


squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

squares_comprehension = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares_comprehension)

6.Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, useful for mapping and lookup operations.

person = {"name": "sai", "age": 25, "city": "Hyderabad"}
print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old and lives in {person['city']}.")

person["email"] = "saigulivindala9912@gmail.com"
print(person)

7.File Handling
Python can read from and write to files using built-in functions.

with open("sai.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")

with open("sai.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

8.Error Handling
Python uses try, except, and finally to handle errors

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
finally:
    print("This block always executes.")
