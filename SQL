SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. 
It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, deleting records, and creating or modifying database structures. 
SQL is widely used in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite.

Key Features of SQL:
Data Retrieval (Querying): Fetch data from databases using SELECT statements.
Data Manipulation: Insert (INSERT), update (UPDATE), and delete (DELETE) data in tables.
Data Definition: Create (CREATE), modify (ALTER), and drop (DROP) tables and other database objects.
Data Control: Manage access to the database using GRANT and REVOKE.
Transaction Control: Ensure data integrity with commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
